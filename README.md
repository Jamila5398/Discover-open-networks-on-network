# Discover-open-networks-on-network
Is to understand the basic network reconnaissance and the open targets which are vulnerable to the real time application, to discover open ports and to mitigate the vulnerable ports.
Reconnaissance is the initial phase where attackers gather information about a target system or network to identify vulnerabilities and plan attacks
This process can involve both active and passive techniques to gather intelligence about the target's systems, networks, and potential weaknesses.
